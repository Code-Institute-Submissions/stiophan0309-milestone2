## Knoydart - Scotland's True Wilderness

Knoydart - Scotland's True Wilderness, is a one stop shop site with information about visiting  the Knoydart peninsula in the Scottish Highlands - the remotest part of mainland Britain.  The site gives information about travelling to Knoydart, accomodation and activities/things to do and see in the area.

Using the site gives users shows that Knoydart is not just for the experienced hillwalker but also for everyone from newlyweds to people seeking to just get away from it all in an idyllic surrounding.

## UX

The site uses a responsive layout so can be viewed on any device and focuses on people looking for information about Knoydart be it for a hill walking experience or a holiday.

The user will see the site is split into sections; **Getting Here**, **Location**, **Accommodation**, **Activities** and **Further Information**,  which are accessed by the options on the Navbar.  Upon clicking the user will be directed to that section where the relavant informations is displayed.  The header/navbar remains at the top for easy navigation. Throughout the site various circled letters appear against different items, these refer to the letter of the relavant map marker on the map in the Location section.

The aforementioned map has map markers or various items and upon clicking upon any given marker an infowindow will appear giving information abou that location.

### In this project I also used:

* Bootstrap - [http://getbootstrap.com/]
    - I use **Bootstrap** to give the project a simple, responsive layout.
    
* jQuery - [https://jquery.com]
    - jQuery was used to access some additional libraries which are required by Bootstrap and Google Maps which give additional function to the site.

* JSON - [https://www.json.org/json-en.html]
    - I use JSON for dynamically storing and accessing data to avoid clutter within HTML and JavaScript code.

## Testing

The following areas were tested during development:

1. Header 
    - upon scrolling down the header reduces in size to reduce screen real estate.
2. Navbar
    - the Navbar links were all tested and should link to the relevant section and should not disappear beneath the header
3.  Map 
    - the map should display markers and clustyer them when in close proximity which when clicked will zoom in to view the markers.  
    - When the markers are clicked they will open an infowindow displaying an image, information about the location  and a link to the relevant website which opens in a new window.
4. Layout 
    - The layout was tested using Google Chrome using various device settings as well as testing responsively by resizing the window.
