                <p>Knoydart is unique as it is not connected to Britain's road network, the only way of reaching the peninsula is hill walking or by boat
                from the nearby port of Mallaig.<br><br>
                Mallaig can be reached by road or rail from Fort William and by ferry from Armadale on the southern tip of the Isle of Skye.  Knoydart can then be accessed by a ferry service
                provided by Western Isles Cruises to Inverie <span class="badge badge-danger">A</span>, the main settlement on Knoydart.<br><br>
                There are 2 main walking routes to Knoydart; via Glen Garry / Kinlochhourn <span class="badge badge-danger">B</span>, or via Loch Arkaig / Glen Dessary <span class="badge badge-danger">C</span>.<br><br>
                It should be noted that there is NO public transport to either Kinlochhourn or Strathan (Loch Arkaig) and both are on single track roads.  Kinlochhourn is accessed from
                the A87 near Invergarry and then a 21 mile trip along a single track road, there is a car park.  Strathan is accessed via from Spean Bridge on the B8004 to Gairlochy, then the B8005 to Loch Arkaig, then an
