                <p>Welcome to Knoydart - the last true wilderness on mainland Britain.<br><br>
                Where is Knoydart?  Knoydart is a remote peninsula tucked away on the west coast of the Scottish Highlands between Loch Hourn 
                and Loch Nevis. What makes Knoydart unique is that it can only be accessed by boat or foot. Knoydart is also home to Britain's remotest pub, the Old Forge located in the only village,
                Inverie, on the peninsula.  The area boasts some stunning scenery, along with exilliarating hill walks and glimpses of whales, dolphins and porpoises.<br><br>
                The map below shows Knoydart's location in the West Highlands, across the Sound of Sleat from the Isle of Skye.  It lies between Loch Hourn and Loch Nevis, locals often refer to them as Loch Hell and
                Loch Heaven.

                <h3 class="section-title">Getting Here</h3>
                <p>Knoydart is unique as it is not connected to Britain's road network, the only way of reaching the peninsula is hill walking or by boat
                from the nearby port of Mallaig.<br><br>
                Mallaig can be reached by road or rail from Fort William and by ferry from Armadale on the southern tip of the Isle of Skye.  Knoydart can then be accessed by a ferry service
                provided by Western Isles Cruises to Inverie, the main settlement on Knoydart.<br><br>
                There are several walking routes to Knoydart, the most common being via Kinlochhourn, Glen Dessary and Glenfinnan.</p>
