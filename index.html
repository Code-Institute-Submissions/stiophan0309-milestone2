                    <p>
                    Knoydart is a remote peninsula tucked away in the Lochaber area of the west coast of the Scottish Highlands between Loch Hourn and Loch Nevis and opposite Sleat, the southern part of the
                    Isle of Skye. <br><br>

                    they may be grouped together.

                <h3 class="section-title">Getting Here</h3>
                <p>Knoydart is unique as it is not connected to Britain's road network, the only way of reaching the peninsula is hill walking or by boat
                from the nearby port of Mallaig.<br><br>
                Mallaig can be reached by road or rail from Fort William and by ferry from Armadale on the southern tip of the Isle of Skye.  Knoydart can then be accessed by a ferry service
                provided by Western Isles Cruises to Inverie <span class="badge badge-danger">A</span>, the main settlement on Knoydart.<br><br>
                There are 2 main walking routes to Knoydart; via Glen Garry / Kinlochhourn <span class="badge badge-danger">B</span>, or via Loch Arkaig / Glen Dessary <span class="badge badge-danger">C</span>.<br><br>
                It should be noted that there is NO public transport to either Kinlochhourn or Strathan (Loch Arkaig) and both are on single track roads.  Kinlochhourn is accessed from
                the A87 near Invergarry and then a 21 mile trip along a single track road, there is a car park.  Strathan is accessed via from Spean Bridge on the B8004 to Gairlochy, then the B8005 to Loch Arkaig, then an
                unclassified road to the other end of the loch.  There is a bothy at Strathan but no car park.</p>

                                Usually the mountain is approached from Barrisdale in the north east of Knoydart but many do a circuit starting at Inverie.</p>

                                It is usually approached from Inverie, but can be approached from Barrisdale as part of a circular route combining Meall Buidhe, and while rough going, it offers soperb views on way to the summit, </p>

                                The usual approach is from Inverie via Gleann an Dubh-lochain to the north of the mountain, but an alternative route via Gleann Meadail to the south is available as well.  Meall Buidhe 
                                is often climbed in combination with Luinne Bheinn as part of a circular route.</p>

                                The mountain also has another record, being the wettest place in the UK with a yearly rainfall average of 200 inches (5,100 mm).<br><br>
                                Unlike the other Knoydart munros, Sgùrr na Cìche is not usually approached from Knoydart itself, but usually from Loch Arkaig or as part of a circuit from Loch Quoich, 
                                although the mountain can be approached from Loch Nevis.
