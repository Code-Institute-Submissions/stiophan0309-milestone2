                    Where is Knoydart?  Knoydart is a remote peninsula tucked away on the west coast of the Scottish Highlands between Loch Hourn
                    and Loch Nevis. What makes Knoydart unique is that it can only be accessed by boat or foot. Knoydart is also home to Britain's remotest pub, the Old Forge located in the only village,
                    Inverie, on the peninsula.  The area boasts some stunning scenery, along with exilliarating hill walks and glimpses of whales, dolphins and porpoises.<br><br>
                    The map below shows Knoydart's location in the West Highlands, across the Sound of Sleat from the Isle of Skye.  It lies between Loch Hourn and Loch Nevis, locals often refer to them as Loch Hell and
                    Loch Heaven.<br><br>
                    For reference purposes, the map below has A-Z markers which show will appear throught the site showing the location of that particular item, please note you may have to zoom in or scroll to see some markers as

                <p>Knoydart is unique as it is not connected to Britain's road network, the only way of reaching the peninsula is hill walking or by boat
                from the nearby port of Mallaig.<br><br>
                Mallaig can be reached by road or rail from Fort William and by ferry from Armadale on the southern tip of the Isle of Skye.  Knoydart can then be accessed by a ferry service
                provided by Western Isles Cruises to Inverie <span class="badge badge-danger">A</span>, the main settlement on Knoydart.<br><br>
                There are 2 main walking routes to Knoydart; via Glen Garry / Kinlochhourn <span class="badge badge-danger">C</span>, or via Loch Arkaig / Glen Dessary <span class="badge badge-danger">D</span>.<br><br>
                It should be noted that there is NO public transport to either Kinlochhourn or Strathan (Loch Arkaig) and both are on single track roads.  Kinlochhourn is accessed from
                the A87 near Invergarry and then a 21 mile trip along a single track road, there is a car park.  Strathan is accessed via from Spean Bridge on the B8004 to Gairlochy, then the B8005 to Loch Arkaig, then an
                unclassified road to the other end of the loch.  There is a bothy at Strathan but no car park.</p>
